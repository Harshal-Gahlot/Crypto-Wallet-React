I wanted to implement a lot of things in wallet and had idea of making games etc..
But even after giving 8+ horse from last 15 days. I couldn't achive them.
# Challanges

1. I made the project in HTML and CSS but TA suggested me to learn and migrate to react. Hence in 6 days I lean react and build this.

2. 5 days of net ban in my area.

3. Too focused on "original design"(frontend) which isn't even super great.

4. Only know HTML CSS and some JS before starting this project
