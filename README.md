I wanted to implement a lot of things in my wallet and had a few ideas like making games etc..
But even after giving 8+ hours for the last 15 days. I couldn't achieve them.

# Challanges

1. Initially, I developed the project in HTML CSS but a TA suggested me to learn and migrate to React. Hence in the last 6 days, I learn React and built this simultaneously.
2. 5 days of Internet ban in my area.
3. Too focused on "original design"(front-end).
4. Only knew HTML CSS and some JS before starting this project
